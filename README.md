# Tarcin Simulation Template  
**Interactive Simulation Builder – 2025 Workflow**

Fork → Paste Prompt → Jules Builds → You Merge → Done!  
Perfect modular simulation.

### How to Build Your Simulation

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|------|-------|
| 1    | Click the green **Fork** button (top-right) | Creates your personal copy instantly |
| 2    | Click **GOLDEN_PROMPT.txt** → Edit (pencil icon) | |
| 3    | Delete all text → paste the **entire** Golden Prompt I sent you → **Commit changes** | Use the default commit message |
| 4    | Open → [https://jules.google.com/session](https://jules.google.com/session) (new tab) | You only open this once per day |
| 5    | Choose **Forked Branch** → Command: Generate the plan with the help of GOLDEN_PROMPT.txt → press Enter | Jule will generate the plan |

That’s it – no more clicking required!

### What Happens Next

| Phase | Jules Does | You Do |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1     | Reads your repo + GOLDEN_PROMPT.txt (10–30 sec) | Nothing |
| 2     | Shows you a **detailed numbered PLAN** in the Jules dashboard | Read it (30–60 sec) |
|  3    | **Waits** for your approval | • If plan is perfect → click **Approve Plan** or type “Approved – proceed”<br>• Want changes? Chat: “Make particles bigger”, “Add sound”, “Use red for saturated” → Jules revises instantly |
| 4     | **Only after your approval** → writes perfect code<br>• `simulation.html` (all UI & scenes)<br>• `simulation.css` (all styles)<br>• `simulation.js` (logic + ≥ 3 smooth animations)<br>• Full light/dark mode support<br>• Automatic bug-check (Critic Mode) | Have a coffee ☕ |
| 5     | Opens a Pull Request titled **“Jules: [Lesson Name] – Ready”** with live preview link | Click **Merge pull request** → simulation is live forever |


### Golden Rules (Never Break)

- Never touch or delete `base-template.html`
- Always paste the **complete** Golden Prompt exactly as given
- Always **review and approve the plan** before Jules writes any code
- Test both light and dark mode after merging
- All visuals → `simulation.html` | All styles → `simulation.css` | All logic → `simulation.js`

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I add images/sounds?**  
Yes – upload them to the repo first, then tell Jules in chat: “Use my crystal.png for crystallisation”

**What if something is wrong?**  
Just type in the dashboard chat: “Fix: particles too fast at 20°C” → fixed in < 1 minute

**Can I request extra features?**  
Absolutely! After approving the plan, say like “Also add visible movement to this element”

**Do I need to pay for Jules?**  
Free tier = 15 sessions/day (plenty). Pro = $20/month unlimited.

### You’re Ready!

Click the green **Fork** button at the top of this page and start building beautiful simulations.
